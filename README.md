# .dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. So it always feels like $HOME...

## Installation

Clone the repository and `./install` the aliases.

Install [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com) and [Oh my
fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish). Then `omf install` and `omf theme agnoster`.

Make sure to install and use a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) for the
agnoster theme to work.
