# .dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. So it always feels like $HOME...

## Installation

1. First, install Python, [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com), [Oh my fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish), and [Thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck).
2. Clone the repository and `./install` the aliases.
3. Then, run `omf install` and `omf theme agnoster`.

Make sure to install and use a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) for the
agnoster theme to work.
